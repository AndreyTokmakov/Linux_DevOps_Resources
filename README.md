# Linux Notes & Tricks

A small, personal repository for **studying Linux behavior in practice** and keeping useful knowledge **close at hand**.

This is not a polished public guide or a tutorial series. It’s a **working notebook**: commands, explanations, experiments, and notes that are useful when dealing with real Linux systems.

---

## Purpose

* Capture how Linux actually works under the hood
* Collect practical DevOps and debugging techniques
* Keep frequently used commands and workflows in one place
* Serve as a personal reference during troubleshooting

---

## Scope

Topics may include:

* Processes, scheduling, and signals
* Memory, page cache, and NUMA
* File systems and block I/O
* Interrupts, softirqs, and IRQ affinity
* Performance analysis and latency tuning
* Observability tools (`procfs`, `perf`, eBPF)
* System-level debugging and tuning


---

## Notes

* Content reflects real systems and experiments
* Defaults are not assumed to be optimal
* Some tuning ideas trade safety for performance

---

## Status

This repository is intentionally **private and evolving**.

Things may be incomplete, opinionated, or change without notice.
